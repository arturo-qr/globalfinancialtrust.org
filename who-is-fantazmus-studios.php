					<h1 class="style1"> Who is Fantazmus Studios?</h1>
					</br>
					<h1 class="style2"> Company Overview</h1>
					</br>
					Fantazmus is a supernatural being and the word itself comes from the Latin word... for something that has been apparently seen, heard, or sensed, elusive or delusive, an image that appears only in the mind, an illusion, fictitious. Fantazmus is also the visible representation of something abstract - ESP as appearing in a dream or hallucination, existing in perception only. In Chinese it translates as Noble Phantasm. The first kanji means <strong>Treasure</strong> and the second means <strong>Tool</strong>. We believe that Classical Art, Music and Architecture are the real Treasures of our society, creation of which has been neglected for at least two centuries.
					</br></br>
					This company is being created as a Tool to finance an effort to motivate artists, musicians and architects to create new Classical Art, Music and Architecture.
					</br></br>
					<strong>Fantazmus Studios </strong>(“Fantazmus”, “Studio” or “Company”) will cut through the obstacles in the television business by building a company based on experience and unparalleled access, responsible and forward thinking financing models and the support of the industry’s most powerful television packaging agencies. 
					</br></br>
					Fantazmus is an independent television production studio focusing on creating, packaging and producing original content television properties including, but not limited to, scripted dramas, comedies, reality shows and game shows.
					</br></br>
					Fantazmus will create fully developed, packaged projects (“TV Properties”) for license to broadcast and cable networks both domestically and internationally. The Company will retain a significant equity portion in each of its respective TV Properties resulting in a library of powerful television assets that will generate recurring high margin revenue. Will generate recurring high margin revenue.
					</br></br>
					The company uses forward thinking financing models and deft producing and deft producing experience instead of writing deficit financing checks to produce its TV Properties. 
					</br></br>
					This results in significant ownership in each property for Fantazmus with limited to no financing risk. 
					</br></br>
					This model requires unique components to work:
					</br></br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>Experienced and trusted executives who can actually produce TV Properties themselves.</li>
						<li>An acute understanding of television financing.</li>
						<li>Working relationships with all of the broadcast and cable networks and the biggest international distributors.</li>
						<li>Unfettered access to, and support FROM THREE of the most powerful television packaging agencies in the world CAA, ICM or WME.</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					The marriage of these unique elements gives Fantazmus many advantages including, but not limited to, the ability to operate as a lean company in terms of overhead, the ability to develop TV properties for a lower development cost per property than a major studio and it gives Fantazmus the ability to offer the most sought after writers and show creators a better deal than the existing studios in terms of their equity participation in the TV Properties they write and create. This means Fantazmus can be a more attractive option to top talent as a producing partner than a major studio.
					</br></br>
					Fantazmus has access to Hollywood’s three marquee talent agencies CAA, ICM and WME. CAA, ICM and WME are the industry’s largest and most respected talent agencies with access to the deepest pool of premium talent including many of the most recognized actors, writers, athletes and entertainment professionals internationally. CAA, ICM and WME have a stellar record in the television industry and have packaged almost every single one of the world’s most recognized shows including American Idol. 
					</br></br>
					Fantazmus will work intimately with Agencies to produce and package projects with select professional talent. As a result of its deep industry relationships, Fantazmus will have access to an unparalleled pool of creative talent, entry into every major broadcast network and cable channel and access to Fortune 500 sponsors, maximizing the likelihood of success for each project.
