					<h1 class="style2">A few simple reasons why this investment makes sense.</h1>
					</br>
					We know it won't be easy to overtake a giant like Google. They are a powerhouse. If a marketing survey about internet search engines was conducted and this question was asked "I was wondering what your favorite search engine is" We all know the answer.
					</br></br>
					Google? It's amazing how everybody says that. Why not? Google's a great search engine. But what if there was an advanced search engine that gave you more precise, more responsive answers than Google and delivered them faster?
					</br></br>
					A next-generation search engine that used neural programming and artificial intelligence to think like humans think? To learn what you expect from search returns and use that knowledge to deliver ever more accurate returns?
					</br></br>
					A search engine that gave you points every time you use it. Points, which will be like frequent flier miles, you could redeem for free travel, upscale electronics, online education, games, software, and all kinds of products and services?
					</br></br>
					Would you use a search engine that could do all that? We think you would and we think so would hundreds of millions of other web surfers. This search engine, a truly revolutionary search engine is called NeuroMama.com. Neuro because it is based on neural technology and gives clear, relevant answers to queries. Global because it leads users from around the world to exactly the places they want to go, notaway from them, Search because, that is pretty obvious.
					</br></br>
					NeuroMama, will be out of beta and online later this this year. It will go public in the near future with an IPO we are certain will be the biggest, most successful IPO in the history of the search engine industry.
					</br></br>
					It will go public with an IPO that will dwarf Yahoo's IPO, that will tower over Google's IPO, that will make its initial investors rich for life â€¦ rich for generations.
					</br></br>
					Do you know that if you had invested $1,000 in Yahoo in the mid-90s you would have earned over $100,000 in less than six months. Did you know that if, ten years later, you'd invested the same amount in Google that investment would have made you half a million dollars?
					</br></br>
					Do you know that now, almost ten years after Google's IPOthat raised their market capitalization from zero to $23 billion in one day, NeuroMama will open with a market capitalization of at least four times that.
					</br></br>
					Do you know adventure capitalists like you who invest $1,000 in NeuroMama today will become instant millionaires the day NPG's IPO launches? You might ask why.
					</br></br>
					Why will NeuroMama public offering blow the lid off all prior search engine IPOs? Because In 2004, when Google went public, no one, most of all investors, knew whether any company could make really big money on the web, any company, let alone a search engine which, the conventional wisdom said, gave its primary product away free.
					</br></br>
					Consider this, Google's earnings the year before it went public were only $106 million? Amazon's earnings for that same year were barely $32 million? In 2004, Amazon shares sold in the 40s and Google's averaged under $100. Today, Amazon is selling for over $230 and Google shares sell for more than $630.
					</br></br>
					In 2004 almost 70 percent of internet users in America connected through a dial-up modem. They could barely surf the web fast enough to read a news story let alone search for bargains, find music and videos and do so many of the things that we routinely use search engines for now - now that over 90 percent of us have always-on broadband connections.
					</br></br>
					That alone, that quantum leap in connectivity makes an advanced new search engine a much more promising and far less risky investment than Yahoo was in the '90s and Google was in 2004.
					</br></br>
					Speaking of risk and let's be totally honest. All high-appreciation investments with huge return potentials have a certain degree of risk. Risk-free investments earn two or three percent, not 1100 or 2500 percent.
					</br></br>
					But you know something, Google and Yahoo, despite their limited earnings, despite the dot.com meltdown, despite the investment community's uncertainty about the future of e-commerce generally, were never high or even medium risk investments, because, and this is a very interesting fact, it was because every search engine public offering in the history of the internet has been successful, wildly successful.
					</br></br>
					Every search engine IPO ever delivered enormous profits to the initial investors. Lycos, Alta Vista, Magellan, InfoSeek - all of them - made their ground-floor, private backers very, very wealthy. NeuroMama will do the same - only more so.
					</br></br>
					More so, much more so, because it will be the first truly 21st Century search engine. The first search engine to substantially advance - revolutionize actually -- search-engine core technology since Google launched in 1998.
					</br></br>
					More so, because Amazon and eBay and most especially - most especially Google, have proved during the eight years since Google's IPO - they have proved to wall street that successful online companies, that search engines are enormously profitable and that they can out-earn even the biggest brick and mortar companies
