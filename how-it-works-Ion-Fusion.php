					<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;A fusion power system of the type designed by FPC is a very large source of energy.  It consists of six major components &#45; ion source, accelerator, chambers, turbine generators for electricity, fuel production unit, and a water distillation unit.  Everything begins with a source of heavy ions that are accelerated to one quarter to one half of the speed of light in a long underground linear accelerator.  The ion beam, after acceleration, is focused on a fuel pellet located inside sphere of lithium metal located at the center of one of ten or more reaction chambers.  These chamber are vacuum chambers and must be at a high vacuum before the reaction can be initiated.  Upon impacting the fuel pellet the ion beam deposits its energy almost instantaneously in a process that compresses the fuel to high density and then heats it to temperatures of more than a million degrees.  This compression and heating allows the fusion of the hydrogen atoms in the fuel resulting in the formation of helium and the release of more than 500 times as much energy as had previously been in the beam.  This release of energy immediately vaporizes the lithium sphere which at the time of impact by the beam was at the center of a strong steel reaction chamber &#45; an object almost 10 meters in dimension.

							The vaporized lithium forms a plasma with the energy content of about 2 barrels of oil.  As the plasma expands, it cools and at about a 1200 degrees Centigrade we begin to extract this energy via a large heat exchange system.  The heat is transferred out of the chamber by a working fluid like Flibe or liquid sodium and then the heat is transferred to helium, an inert gas identical to that used in party balloons.  The high temperature helium is fed to turbines that drive an electrical generator to produce electricity.  A portion of this electricity is sent to market as electricity and the remainder is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.  The oxygen is captured for market or is released to the atmosphere and the hydrogen from the electrolytic process is piped to a syn-gas generator where it chemically reacted with CO2 taken from the atmosphere or the ocean to form carbon monoxide, CO, and water.  The water, really steam, is combined with steam produced by the waste heat from the Helium turbine generators and fed to conventional steam turbines to create more electricity.  The CO is reacted with additional hydrogen to form the building block CH2 with the release of more steam.  The CH2 building block is then used to form long chain hydrocarbons such as gasoline(petrol), diesel, and jet fuel all of which are designated as &ldquo;green fuels&ldquo;  because all of their carbon came from CO2 taken from the atmosphere.  Thus they are carbon neutral when burned and returned to the atmosphere after passing through an engine.

							Finally, he lowest temperature heat from the reaction chamber is fed to shell and tube condensers where it is used as heat to distill sea water, producing fresh water for irrigation and household use.  There is enough low temperature heat to distill hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of water per day.
							<br><br>
							The cycle described above is repeated once a second in each chamber and a full system has 10 or more chambers.  This means that the energy being made available by the sum of all 10 fusion  reaction chambers is equivalent to the energy in about 20 barrels of oil every second.  About half of this energy is captured and appears as the marketable products of electricity, synthetic liquid fuel (identical in all respects to current supplies of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel) and water derived from the distillation of sea water.  The only significant waste product is the salt from the sea water and even that can be used as a industrial chemical and the waste heat that is discharged to the atmosphere or to the sea.  Similar waste heat is a typical discharge from any power plant installation.
							<br><br>
							There is a small amount of radioactivity produced by the system.  This is from the interaction of the neutrons with the lithium and the steel walls of the chamber and these materials may become weakly radioactive.  By US standards they are not radioactive enough to require disposal in a radioactive waste repository.  Instead they are allowed to be buried on site as the short term radioactivity declines with time.  But this only is an issue upon plant abandonment and there are many kilometers of tunnels in which this underground short term storage could take place.
							<br><br>
							The worst case accident is a lithium fueled fire.  Each chamber has more than 10 tonnes of liquid lithium in circulation as its primary heat exchange fluid.  This lithium is also the source of half of our fuel for the tritium needed for future reactions is produced by the neutrons when they interact with the lithium.  All of this lithium is inside the vacuum tight containment vessel which is surrounded by an inert atmosphere of Argon, a gas taken from the atmosphere where it has a concentration of about 1 percent.  The other element of the fuel the heavy isotope of hydrogen comes from seawater where there is sufficient supply to last for millions of years.
							<br/><br/>
							There is essentially no residual radioactivity and the heat from the chamber is more dangerous than its residual radioactivity.  There is no danger of a runaway reaction for there is no fuel in the chamber except that introduced for each pulse.  If the vacuum fails to restore after a pulse, that chamber just stops and the liquid lithium is shunted into a heated storage container and sealed until the problem is repaired.
