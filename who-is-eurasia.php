					<h1 class="style1"> Who is Eurasia Hotel Casino Mega Resort?</h1>
					</br>
					<h1 class="style2">Eurasia</h1>
					</br>
					<b>EURASIA Hotel/Casino Resort has been researched, designed and will be developed, implemented, managed and operated by taking into consideration the following perspectives:</b>
					</br></br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>Financing.</li>
						<li>Sales, Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations.</li>
						<li>Magnets and Attractions.</li>
						<li>Management and Operations.</li>
						<li>Utilization of EURASIA's resources.</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					Although EURASIA is a big project, it is a modular project and represents a host successful moneymaking formulas.
					</br></br>
					Every single element of EURASIA is operating somewhere in the world today and is generating substantial profits for its shareholders.
					</br></br>
					We will create Joint Ventures among the top companies specializing in managing and operating similar businesses, which makes EURASIA for others or for themselves.
					</br></br>
					We will pay this companies certain percentage of gross sales, as well as an override on products and services provided for the benefit of EURASIA.
					</br></br>
					We will reward this companies for reaching and exciding EURASIA financial goals, with cash, stock and options.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to identify the type of synergetic businesses with consistent and successful money making formulas and to strategically combine them into EURASIA business model, which will enjoy multiple revenue streams, with each one of them benefiting from synergy of other business elements and resulting in high EBDTIA Margins.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to identify the marketing strategy, which will provide the most exposure to EURASIA and deliver savings on marketing, advertising, public relations, management and operations to businesses of EURASIA.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to capitalize on savings which are delivered by utilizing services of Global Family of Companies received on cost or cost plus basis.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to capitalize on its own contacts and relations as well as to network with individuals and companies, which has established business and/or personal relationship of management, shareholders and partners.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to provide general design, marketing strategies and to coordinate execution of each element of EURASIA and EURASIA as a whole.
					</br></br>
					Global's task is to capitalize on the resources provided by Global's family of companies at no cost, at cost, or on the cost plus basis to develop library of entertainment assets, which will provide a safety net for Global Family of companies' shareholders.
					</br></br>
					The entertainment assets will secure shareholder value and insure shareholders against changes in business climate, competition, economy, preferences of consumers, as well as Global's own business failures.
					</br></br>
					Every traveler knows, a journey is a lot less risky when you have directions. Therefore, EURASIA has clearly defined its long term goal, which is to create the portfolio of entertainment and internet assets by producing its own content, acquiring content produced by other companies, as well as acquiring companies, which own libraries of entertainment and internet assets. As a part of the distribution goals, EURASIA will license its content to US and foreign distributors of entertainment content, EURASIA will also package its own or licensed content, develop new TV channels, and distribute this channels by connecting it to existing cable and satellite networks.

						<li>Fantazmus Global 3 in Las Vegas and Phase 2</li>
						<li>Fantazmus Studios in Las Vegas Phase 1 and Phase 2</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					To achieve this goals EURASIA will need resources. This project has been selected as the interim vehicle for the development of these resources, which will consists of commercial rental property, hotels, sports and live entertainment venues, these assets as well as the income it generates should support high market capitalization and high liquidity levels of EURASIA family of companies equities. Highly liquid equity will represent an ultimate acquisition currency to accelerate EURASIA growth and to achieve its long term goals to create portfolio of entertainment and internet assets.
					</br></br>
					EURASIA has access to adequate financial resources in order to launch the first phase.
					</br></br>
					When additional funds will be required, in order to implement the first and the second phase, EURASIA will raise required capital by selling financial instrument to high networth foreign accredited investors under Reg. D. 506 Private Placement.
					</br></br>
					At the appropriate time along with foreign investors, others will be invited as well to make the initial investment into EURASIA, and to consider future investments.
					</br></br>
					Investors payoff will have the following five characteristics.
					</br></br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>It is simple.</li>
						<li>It is fair.</li>
						<li>It is emphasized trust rather than legal ties.</li>
						<li>It will not blow apart if actual differs slightly from plan.</li>
						<li>It will not provide perverse incentives that will cause one or both parties to behave destructively.</li>
					</ul>

					The notion - like the idea that excruciatingly detailed financial projections are useful - is nonsense. New ventures are inherently risky, what can go wrong will.
					</br></br>
					When that happens, we hope that our investors don't panic, don't get angry, and don't refuse to advance the company more money.
					</br></br>
					By contrast, we hope that our investors roll up their sleeves and help the company solve its problems.
					</br></br>
					We think about capital acquisition as a dynamic process - to figure out how much money we will need and when we will need it. The way we accomplish this, is by treating the new venture as a series of experiments.
					</br></br>
					Before launching the whole show, we launch a little piece of it. Then we will convene a focus group to test the product, build a prototype and watch it perform, conduct a regional or local rollout of a service.
					</br></br>
					Such exercise will reveal the true economics of the business and will help enormously in determining how much money our venture actually requires and in what stages.
					</br></br>
					We will raise enough, and investors will invest enough capital to fund each major experiment.
					</br></br>
					Experiments, of course, can feel expensive and risky. However, it will prevent disasters and help create successes. It is a prerequisite of a winning deal.
					</br></br>
					We assure you that our business model is not an albatross that hangs around the neck of our entrepreneurial team, dragging it into oblivion. Instead, our business model is a call for action, one that recognizes management's responsibility to fix what is broken proactively and in real time. Risk is inevitable, avoiding risk impossible. Risk management is the key, which will tilt our venture in favor of reward and away from risk.
					</br></br>
					Our goal is to demonstrate mastery of the entire entrepreneurial process, from identification of opportunity to harvest. Joint Marketing Strategy Agreement... will create for as this opportunity.
					</br></br>
					It's up to the management, to turn the shareholder's perception into a reality... Not because the people part of the new venture is the most important, but because without the right team, none of the other parts really matters.
					</br></br>
					What and whom we know are matters of insight and experience. How familiar the team members with industry players and dynamics? We are, not surprisingly, value managers who have been around the block a few times.
					</br></br>
					We personally believe that ideas are a dime a dozen: only execution skills count.
					</br></br>
					Although, we are convinced that all of our ideas are great. However, in case we had made some mistakes, they'll make a switch for another idea, and shareholders will make money one way or the other.
