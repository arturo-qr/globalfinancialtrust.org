					</br>
					Global Assets will hold all of the entertainment assets owned by Global Finanacial Trust, and its other sister companies. They will also hold the media assets where we have exclusive distribution rights. These assets are worth billions and will be made up of entertainment programming, tens of thousands of featured films, hundreds of thousands of hours of broadcast and cable TV series, special events, sports, education programs, and millions of hours of programs and an ever-expanding collection of exclusive online games designed by our own inhouse gaming division.
					</br></br>
					Most of these assets are legally protected for up to 120 years as intellectual property. The assets will reside in a digital format so the cost of storing and caring for such an asset is extremely low. The assets value will never be decreased due to inflation. These assets will produce dividends year after year, and decade after decade.
					</br></br>
					We are building a superior digital archiving platform which will store this media on 5 continents in an ultra-safe, hardened, and secure facility. We provide a number of tools that assist in the re-purposing of the assets and their enhanced restoration and media conversions. We will serve this media content to our own businesses and for a fee serve the content to other distribution channels. With our vast library of entertainment and media content, digital media asset management will become this ventures number one priority.
					</br></br>
					Revenue will be generated as the media held in our library is distributed. The media will be offered to our sister companies at a fraction of the cost they would need to pay to any other content provider. This content will be licensed and distributed through other distribution channels around the world.
					</br></br>
					With Global Entertainment Assets vast library we will be the best at library asset management where it is critical that one excel in the storage and retrieval of large amounts of infrequently changing media assets, for example in video archiving.
					</br></br>
					Assets in our online gaming venture, Global Tech Ideas, Ltd.. may need to be managed using production asset management, with a focus on storage, organization and revision control of frequently changing digital assets.
					</br></br>
					We believe there will be a day, in the very near future, where a customer can only buy a movie, music, or a game in its digital media format via the Internet. We will be at the forefront of that trend and push our digital content out to digital retailers so they donâ€™t have the burden of storing this content.
					</br></br>
					These assets can be licensed for sale or rented over and over again. There is no other asset like this in the world. Every movie, television show, music album or game can be rented or licensed for sale tens of thousands of times.
