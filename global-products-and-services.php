					This division will function somewhat similar to the Home Shopping Network but will only be utilized over our Content Delivery Network. We will use our vast reach into various merchandisers and distributors to buy distressed and discontinued merchandise in the following categories.
					</br></br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>Jewelry</li>
						<li>Fashion</li>
						<li>Beauty</li>
						<li>Health & Fitness</li>
						<li>Infomercials</li>
						<li>For Home Decoration</li>
						<li>Kitchen & Dining</li>
						<li>Electronics</li>
						<li>Crafts & Sewing</li>
						<li>Toys</li>
						<li>NFL items</li>
						<li>Collectibles</li>
						<li>Personalized gifts</li>
						<li>Outdoors</li>
					</ul>
					</br></br>
					The products will be bought at discounts that can be as high as 90% off retail. We in turn will use these products and services in a variety of different ways. A high percentage of the merchandise will be given away to users of our Search Engine offering. They will be given away through constantly running raffles and through the redemption of Frequent Search Points (FSP). Since almost all of our products will be limited in quantity, we will offer a certain percentage via a timed auction off of our search engine for those that want the product and are willing to pay for the product. Those who pay will be allowed to buy all our products at cost plus 20% to offset our costs associated with the buying and selling of the product.
					</br></br>
					In addition, to the product offerings in this division we will become a major player in the timeshare industry. We have a management team with vast amounts of experience in this area, and they are currently seeing a time like no other to get back into this very distressed industry. Product can be had for up to 80% discount from the record highs in 2006/2007. Our distressed and underutilized product offers that we buy will also become a prime focus to be used as the gifts required to be given away in this industry.
