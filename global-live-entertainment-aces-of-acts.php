					Global Financial Trust,. will use Aces of Acts till launch TViMama to the masses around the world. The expectation is this tour event will be widely covered by the media which will give TViMama the mass exposure so important to build the scale required to obtain the necessary content our subscribers will demand on an on-going basis.

					As Aces of Acts is a primary marketing tool we use as part of our marketing plan, we will not offer this to the public at this time. We need 100% control of this venture to ensure our marketing plan stays on track. Should we take Aces of Acts public, their first priority would be to earn a profit. We need their first priority to be our marketing and promotional plans.
