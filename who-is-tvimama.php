					</ul>
					<br>
					Our business requires the availability of archived content and an extensive programming selection for our subscribers. Therefore, we will ask in our Revenue Sharing Agreements with television, production and distribution companies for the placement of their entire content inventory into our distribution channels; and making it available to our subscribers for viewing, regardless of its perceived value, popularity, age or the date of broadcast. 
					<br><br>
					With this unique business model we hope to avoid competition with the Netflix&acute;s of the world, which are competing for popular movies with everyone else. 
					<br><br>
					Our strategic technology partner has proven &ldquo;that one man&acute;s trash is another man&acute;s treasure&rdquo; by charging $50.00 U.S. to its millions of subscribers per month for the right to watch their very extensive library, with half of the revenue going to content providers. 
					<br><br>
					With this business model TViMama will provide its Spanish language subscribers with a greater supply of television programming than any other company providing access to TV content via internet connectivity. In addition to almost a million readily available public domain programs, constant renewal and high quality broadcast signals enable viewers to watch everything from the latest news, series, melodramas, comedies, detective stories, documentaries and cartoons... to every 20 year old news program, educational or any other program or movie. Our technological delivery and database system will prove to be necessary, informative and beneficial to most people. For example: subscribers will be able to search every program that was broadcast for the past 20 years by a specific title name, or for content in the description of the program, theme, director, producer, writer, actor and etc. 
					<br><br>
					With almost 1 billion people speaking Spanish, TViMama is potentially a multi-billion dollar TV-On-Demand business. TViMama will offer Spanish speaking subscribers premium digital entertainment content streamed to any television, digital device or multimedia box for anytime, anywhere entertainment enjoyment.
