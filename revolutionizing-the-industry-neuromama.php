					<h1 class="style2">Why our search engine will revolutionize the industry</h1>
					</br>
					An investor who knows that no matter how revolutionary, no matter how advanced, no matter how much better than the competition a technology is, it's worthless if no one tries it. if no one uses it. We believe the answer to this problem is so simple that even the airlines have figured it out. In fact, they figured it out 30 years ago. The airlines call it FFR or Frequent Flier Rewards at NEUROMAMA.com we call it FSR - frequent searcher rewards.
					</br></br>
					FSR is very simply a customer loyalty program. Every time a person uses NEUROMAMA.com they earn search points. These are points that can be converted to one of hundreds of premiums. The best premiums of any loyalty program in any industry anywhere. Premiums ranging from weekend vacations in resorts around the world at the bottom of the points scale to world cruises and high-end luxury electronics at the top end. These are premiums that we are getting for free.
					</br></br>
					It's actually better than that - we're not only getting the premiums for free - we're getting paid for offering the premiums - we're making money on the premiums. This is because we have contracted to trade discounts on NeuroMama.com advertising impressions for products in the hospitality, travel, electronics and recreation industries.
					</br></br>
					There is also another side benefit here. Once these major companies signing on with us to get these favorable barter-plus ad rates experience tremendous traffic and high sales conversion ratio they get from NeuroMama after they feel the power of advertising with us they will be doubling, tripling, and even quadrupling their commitments at our full rates.
					</br></br>
					We have premiums for people of every interest - all the traditional kinds of loyalty rewards that other companies offer plus. Plus dozens of internet-user specific premiums that no one else has ever thought of - premiums like hundreds of free hours of play on the web's most popular games, free classes from some of the best online universities, free ebook and audiobook downloads.
					</br></br>
					We are even making deals with some of the top online casinos to offer thousands of dollars in matching funds as a premium. In our opinion, now that some of these casinos are finally going after American customers again this will be one of our most popular premiums, right up there with the free travel packages.
					</br></br>
					But it doesn't matter what's the most popular. What matters is that there's something for everyone. Which will mean that users of NeuroMama.com will not only be getting a far better, more efficient and highly productive search experience, they will they will at the same time be satisfying one of the most basic human emotions - greed . - the desire to get something for nothing.
					</br></br>
					And, also, also they will be getting a constant reminder of how good NeuroMama is not just because of the quality of the results but because of NeuroMama raw speed. Because we're going to give an extra 1000 bonus search points every time a search takes more than one second to complete.
					</br></br>
					So one thing we know, they're going to be watching for that, they're going to be hoping we lag a bit and they're going to be amazed how few of those free bonus points they get. They might get maybe once every couple of thousand searches, probably less often than that. But when we are talking about speed - There's one thing you have to be aware of - time - time is not on your side. The venture capitalists are coming and frankly we need them because you're like me, an entrepreneur, an adventure capitalist, a small investor who recognizes once in a decade, once in a lifetime opportunities and jumps on them.
					</br></br>
					But, you know once you get to phase two and phase three of building a global empire like this there's no substitute for a VC firm that can write a check for millions of dollars. And the VC's know it - guys that can write those million dollar checks didn't get to manage investment banks and hedge funds by being stupid. They understand this totally the power they have, and one way they exercise that power is by insisting that the companies they write those big checks to close the door after them - close the door to other investors, particularly small investors.
					</br></br>
					Nobody can really blame them. That is their business. It isn't their business to be nice to people and cut large checks. There business is to insure their funds grow at the highest possible level with the least amount of risk. They have losers along the way so it is critical for them to control every point and fraction of a point of equity they can get their hands on before the IPO. This means limiting, to put it very, very mildly, the number of other investors.
					</br></br>
					So while they can't do anything about investors who are already in. They can and they do contractually forbid companies from adding additional investors or - except in the case of preexisting agreements - allowing existing investors to increase their participation.
					</br></br>
					Today's opportunity to get rich and to protect your right to get even richer down the road, but it is a today thing. The gold ring is hanging in front of your hand but you have to reach out and grab it today.
