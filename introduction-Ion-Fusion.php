					&emsp;&emsp;Energy is the lifeblood of modern society.  Companies and nations are searching the globe for any sign of an energy supply that is underdeveloped or underutilized.  Fusion, as a new energy source, is looked upon as unproven or too risky for industrial involvement with the result that only a few countries spend significant amounts of money for fusion research and most of that goes into magnetic confinement fusion or laser driven fusion.  At the same time more than $1 trillion are being spent each year on the search for new or underutilized fossil fuel energy sources (Fuelfix, 2012).  All of these expenditures come from the profits of the energy industry. Even more billions of dollars are being  projected for expenditure on new fission facilities. Energy is a very big and expensive business yet, almost no industry investment is being made in advanced energy systems such as accelerator driven fusion systems.
					<br><br>
					This failure of industry to accept the challenge of fusion may be rooted in history.  Fusion, as a subject, promised to deliver a virtually unlimited supply of energy in 20 years time more that 60 years ago and now we find that scientists are still looking for fusion to be 'on-line' in 30 to 50 years. Industry has also been led to expect a 'government demonstration of feasibility' as was done for fission.  The commitment to achieve 'ignition' by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a similar promise to demonstrate feasibility but it has not been delivered.
					<br><br>
					The root cause of the lack of adequate research support for Heavy Ion Fusion (HIF) probably lies in a committee decision made in late 1981 when a design concept developed by the US National Laboratories and recommended by ERDA, the predecessor of the US Department of Energy, was denied funding in favor of other programs.  The appropriation language in PUBLIC LAW 97-90 (1982) says <em>&ldquo; . . . (IV) $7,500,000 shall be used for supporting research and experiments, except that none of such funds may be used for the research, development, or demonstration of the use of heavy ion devices as drivers for defense inertial confinement fusion experiments and defense inertial confinement fusion systems.&rdquo; </em>
					<br><br>
					The purpose of this denial of the funding for the DOE 'weapons labs' may have been appropriate for  HIF cannot be used as a weapon.  Thus the prohibition of use of the funds for &ldquo;defense inertial confinement fusion&rdquo; may have been justified.  Had a home for HIF in the basic sciences part of DOE been created, as was apparently planned, this prohibition might have been appropriate.  But no such home was created and thus the specific deletion of funding for HIF has had the effect of shelving, for decades, one of the most likely ways of achieving fusion. Without an agency leadership home there has been no 'voice' in the budget battles for more than three decades.  Nor has there been a source of support for the necessary validation experiments.
					<br><br>
					Lack of leadership within DOE in civilian applications of HIF, as opposed to 'weapons applications', was clearly one of the root causes of lack of progress in the application of HIF in the US.  But the underlying assumption that fusion has to be like other systems and be able to produce power in a small facility (1GW capacity) is clearly a supporting element.  This necessity was emphasized in an EPRI report (Kaslow, et al 1994) where criteria for practical fusion power systems were summarized.  Kaslow et al emphasized size flexibility (1 GW or less), economics, public acceptance, and regulatory simplicity.  This over defining of the requirements for fusion using electrical output as the only output measure makes it difficult for large systems to compete.
