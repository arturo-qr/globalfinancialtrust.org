					<span class="style3" style="font-size: 12px">Last modified: July 24, 2013</span>					
					<br/></br>					
					There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Neuromama.com Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2" style="font-size: 13pt">Our Privacy Policy explains:</span>
					</br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
						<li>How we use that information.</li>
						<li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Neuromama.com so whether you are new to Neuromama.com or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.
					</br></br></br>
					<span class="style2">Information we collect</span>
					</br>
					We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">We collect information in two ways:<br/></span>
					Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Neuromama.com Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number etc.. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Neuromama.com Profile, which may include your name and photo.<br/>
					Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Device information<br/></span>
					We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Neuromama.com may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Neuromama.com Account.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Log information<br/></span>
					When you use our services or view content provided by Neuromama.com, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
					details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
					telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Internet protocol address.<br/></span>
					device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
					cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Neuromama.com Account.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Location information<br/></span>
					When you use a location-enabled Neuromama.com service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Unique application numbers<br/></span>
					Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Neuromama.com when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Local storage<br/></span>
					We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
					<br/><br/><span class="style6">Cookies and anonymous identifiers<br/></span>
					We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Neuromama.com service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Neuromama.com features that may appear on other sites.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">How we use information we collect</span>
						<br/>
						We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Neuromama.com and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
						</br></br>
						We may use the name you provide for your Neuromama.com Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Neuromama.com Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Neuromama.com Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Neuromama.com Profile information, such as your name and photo.
						</br></br>
						When you contact Neuromama.com, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
						</br></br>
						We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
						</br></br>
						We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Neuromama.com services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.
						</br></br>
						We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
						</br></br>
						Neuromama.com processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">Transparency and choice</span>
						</br>
						People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:

					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">With domain administrators</span>
					</br>
					If your Neuromama.com Account is managed for you by a domain administrator then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Neuromama.com Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:

					</br>
					We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">For legal reasons</span>
					</br>
					We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Neuromama.com if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
					</br>
						<ul class="simple">
							<li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
							
							<li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>

							<li>If Neuromama.com is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
						</ul>
					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">Information security</span>
					</br>
					We work hard to protect Neuromama.com and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="style6">We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</span>
					</br>
					We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
					</br>
					We restrict access to personal information to Neuromama Ltd. employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">Application</span>
					</br>
					Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Neuromama Ltd. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
					</br>
					Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Neuromama.com services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">Enforcement</span>
					</br>
					We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style6">Changes</span>
