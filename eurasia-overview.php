					<h1 class="style3">Community Based Projects</h1>

We intend to have educational and training facilities not only for our staff, but also for coaches and promoters in the Sports Pavilion, educational facilities in the Technology Pavilion, educational facilities within the International facilities, educational facilities in Fantazmus Studios, and one project dear to our heart - the Palace of Little Angels. The Palace of Little Angels is a children's after school and weekend learning and event center. We plan on creating a new education standard by providing an enriched cultural environment using the resources available throughout the complex. Children will have access to advanced level extracurricular programs in fine and performing arts, instruction in music lessons and history - with an emphasis on learning to play an instrument, ballet, drama, literature and science. Athletic programs include gymnastics, golf, tennis, equestrian skills, archery as well as "finishing school". The Palace will be administered by experienced professionals with requisite management skills, including individuals with hands on managerial experience with a similar program, The Palace of Pioneers in Russia.
					</br></br>
					<h1 class="style3">Wind Farms- Renewable Energy to feed EURASIA for power</h1>
					</br>
					EURASIA will contract development of Wind Farms to be used as a source of renewable electric power for a portion, if not all, of EURASIA's energy needs. All buildings and attractions will be developed and implemented as Green Buildings. Considerations for the environment and water conservation will be at the utmost importance, as we aim to be leaders in the environmental causes as well.
					</br></br>
					The EURASIA project will change the face of Las Vegas. Las Vegas has always been on the cutting edge - creating newer, more exciting destinations for visitors to see. Designed by Tilke Engineering and crafted by J.T. Kruer and Company, EURASIA will take Las Vegas to the next level. Visitor volume to Las Vegas has been stagnant for the last 7 years - tourists need to have something new to see to move the needle. EURASIA is the future, and will not only produce an enormous increase in taxable revenues to the state, but also will bring more international visitors because of our exposure in those markets. Only 16% of Las Vegas visitors come from foreign counties. Our clientele, or expertise, our design is geared to market to international visitors. The EURASIA project IS the future and is destined to change how the world thinks about Las Vegas.
