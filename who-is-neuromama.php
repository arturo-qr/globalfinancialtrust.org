					<h1 class="style2">NeuroMama.com... The Search Engine</h1>
					</br>
					Hard as it may be to believe, the core technology driving every general purpose search engine in the world has remained static for almost 15 years.
					</br></br>
					Google, which launched in Q3, 1998, totally replaced previous engines' virtually total obsession with keywords and metatags with a model based on "site authority" as determined by links, relevant content, the amount of and freshness of that content and numerous other factors.
					</br></br>
					By the time Google went public in 2004, every other major search engine - MSN, MSLIVE, Yahoo, Ask, Lycos, etc. -- had adopted their own somewhat tweaked version of Google's model and both Google and every other popular search engine (including Microsoft Bing) is still using that model today.
					</br></br>
					To say that Google's 1998 launch was responsible for a sea change in search engine technology is a massive understatement. What it actually created was a planetary change. Whatever one calls it, however, sea change or planetary change or intergalactic change, it is still a 15-year-old change, a 20th Century change, an antique - as computer technology time is measured - change.
					</br></br>
					Google and the other engines have for better or worse (worse, according to most experts, in the case of Google's recent Panda and Penguin updates) continuously tweaked, refined and massaged the mathematical algorithms that apply the ranking rules. The basic technologies, however, the assumptions about what makes a site good or bad, an authority or not an authority, are still the same as when they were written into programs code in the mid-90s.
					</br></br>
					They are still rooted in a world where more than 90 percent of internet connections were made through temporary, snail-paced dialup connections - a world where e-commerce was still an untried, entirely unproven concept - a world where no one searched the web for movies, music or games because there were none to be found.
					</br></br>
					A world where the World Wide Web -- which only became available to the general public in 1994 - was itself a new arrival on the Internet scene, a baby with an enormous amount of potential that few people at the time could even begin to define.
					</br></br>
					If you were Google CEO Larry Page and hearing footsteps threatening your empire from all points of the compass, not just Facebook, but from better, more advanced search technologies waiting to be released, you might also trade the integrity of your search results for a big short term hike in revenue and profit. What one man's doomed business model is? It's another guy's gateway to riches, to fortune to success, to the billion-dollar business model of the future.
					</br></br>
					Imagine a 21st Century search engine. Imagine a search engine that uses neural programming and artificial intelligence to think and learn like humans. Imagine a search engine that delivers more precise, more responsive answers than Google and delivers them faster. Imagine a search engine that awards points every time someone uses it. Points, which like frequent flier miles, can be redeemed for free travel, upscale electronics, online education, games, software ... all kinds of products and services? Imagine how many of the world's hundreds of millions of Web users would prefer such an advanced search engine.
					</br></br>
					You've just imagined NeuroMama.com.
					</br></br>
					Neuro because it is based on neural technology and gives clear, relevant answers to queries.
					</br>
					Global because it leads users from around the world to exactly the places they want to go, not away from them.
					</br></br>
					Search because that's what NeuroMama will do. Do better than any other search engine ever. A product of a three-year collaboration between a gold-standard team of application developers in the U.S. and Russian Institute of Mathematics and Physics, one of the world's leading research and development centers for mathematicians, engineers and behavioral psychologists using neural technology principles to add natural, rational reasoning and learning capability to artificial intelligence systems, neural technology gives NeuroMama.com the ability to shape its search returns based on many crucial indices unavailable to other search engines including Google, Yahoo and Bing.
					</br></br>
					Among them are:
					</br></br>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li><strong>Visitation frequency:</strong> The percentage of people who having visited a website once return to it again and how often they do so. This statistic is a reliable indicator of the overall value end users place upon a website.</li>
						<li><strong>Dwell time:</strong> Websites which are abandoned quickly generally offer little value to visitors who arrived there by clicking on a search engine return for a specific keyword or phrase. Websites on which visitors "dwell" for an above average period of time, on the other hand, tend to provide quality information on the subject of interest.</li>
						<li><strong>Drill depth:</strong> Whereas dwell time data provides insights about the quality and authority of the information on a website, drill depth – the number of internal site pages the average visitor accesses – delivers a snapshot of the quantity of useful information contained on a site and the quality and user-friendliness of the site’s navigation system.</li>
					</ul>
